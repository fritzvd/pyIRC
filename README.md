pyIRC
=====

Just a simple IRC Logging bot combined with a web front-end. It uses Python and AppEngine and is open for development.

I use the [Ninja IDE](http://github.com/ninja-ide/ninja-ide) channel as placeholder code and in the linked site, but you can customize it to log any channel on any server.

Documentation
------------

Honestly, there's not enough code here to justify documenting it. But there's the best documentation of all, just UTSL :)

Credits

Special thanks to the writers of [Python IRCLib](http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/), an extremely useful event-driven IRC client framework without whose abstractions this project would take 3 times more time to write.
