Ninja IDE IRC
=============

Just a simple IRC Logging bot combined with a web front-end. It uses Python and AppEngine and open for development.

It's not _specifically_ tailored to Ninja, that's just the channel I use it for. You can customize it to log any channel on any server.

Feel free to customize, comment, fork, pull-request or anything that you want to.
